    "The dataset for this project comes from a Minecraft research server operated by the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI), a computer science research group at UBC led by Professor Frank Wood. PLAI studies generative modeling, programming, and AI. Their PLAICraft initiative collects large-scale behavioral data from real players navigating a shared virtual server in Minecraft. Every player who joins the server contributes to a growing dataset that supports research on how humans play video games and how they interact within this specific environment.\n",

    "Game analytics plays a central role in understanding how people interact with digital environments. By examining patterns in player activity such as a player's session frequency, duration, and engagement levels, we can further research about human behavior and AI to better predict resource allocation and user engagement. Since this server is an active research project rather than a commercial game, understanding player behavior and activity levels is essential so they can plan server hardware, storage, and data-processing resources effectively. Specifically, being able to identify which players engage the most with the game can support targeted recruitment and improved strategies for maintaining long-term engagement\n",
